# Differences between app, npm and pygologin
GoLogin is software 💻 that lets you **hide** 😶 and **control** your digital fingerprint by spoofing all parameters that sites can see. By masking these settings, **you can imitate a real Internet 🌎 identity to bypass anti-fraud systems**.

Gologin also has an API 🤟 and you can connect to it and integrate with other programs to, for example, automate some processes using self-written bots 👨‍💻.

API exists in **npm package**, as well as **python**.
